This page is about my research in [Sara Merino-Aceituno's kinetic theory group](https://saramerinoaceituno.wordpress.com/).

My research interests are:
- biomathematics
  - epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition in the chick neural tube
- mechanics
  - nonsmooth dynamical systems 
  - elasticity
- numerics
  - position-based dynamics (PBD)
  - geometric numerical methods (sympectic methods, finite element exterior calculus)
